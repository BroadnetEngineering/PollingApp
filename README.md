# Polling App
Design a polling application.

### Your application should accomplish the following:
* Able to create, read, update, and delete polls
* Show all available polls to take
* Count a poll taker only once, and allow them to update their answer (within reason, you shouldn't create an account system, think of another way to track a user)
* Show poll results to user after taking the poll

### The app should follow these rules:
* Use a MySQL database
* Be written in PHP for backend technology, frontend is up to you
* No existing MVC frameworks
