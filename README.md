# Polling App
Design a polling application.

### Your application should accomplish the following:
* Able to create, read, update, and delete polls
* Show all available polls to take
* Count a poll taker only once, and allow them to update their answer (within reason, you shouldn't create an account system, think of another way to track a user)
* Show poll results to user after taking the poll

### The app should follow these rules:
* You may use the language of your choice.
* The frontend portion of your app is entirely freeform.
* If you use MySQL or similar, you must provide a SQL script to create the schema as part of your pull request.
